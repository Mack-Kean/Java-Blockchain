# Java Blockchain
### A proof of concept blockchain built in java
---
This program represents an abstract blockchain network where blocks are created (mined) by miners on the network using a
Proof-Of-Work algorithm similar to bitcoin.  The code in the Block.java class was borrowed from [This tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/java-blockchain)
with some minor changes to suit my simulation better.
